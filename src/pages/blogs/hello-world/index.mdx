Actually you can read about me on the [/about](/about) page, but I think I should add a few things here too. My name is **Fahmi Idris**, usually called Fahmi but it's up to you what you want to call me. I was born in Bogor Regency in 2002, to be exact in July.

## Junior High School

When I was in junior high school, I already had a computer hobby because I often played games at the internet cafe even though my parents forbade it hehe. However, at that time I did not know anything about the programming, all I knew was social media, games, and Ms. Offices.

Until finally when I was in 9th grade, so many vocational schools were promoting their majors, and there was one that I was interested in, namely **Software Engineering**. At that time, there were a lot of Computer and Network Engineering majors, but I underestimated the major, it was too easy.

<Alert message="Don't be offended, all I knew was that the Computer and Network Engineering major was just disassembling computers, and making network cables. Other people say it's hard, but I think it's really easy, like playing LEGO." />

When introducing Software Engineering, they said that this major is more focused on software/applications. Without thinking, I chose to enter that major!
