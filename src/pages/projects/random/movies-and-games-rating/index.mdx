## Short explanation

This is the result of working on the final project of the Candradimuka Jabar Coding Camp 2021 online phase. Instructors provide APIs for use on the web in order to perform the Create, Read, Update, and Delete processes. With several requirements, one of which is to use a UI Framework such as [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com), [Material UI](https://mui.com), or [ANT Design](https://ant.design).

## Technologies are used

The technology used to build this website is:

- JavaScript
- React.js
- Chakra UI
- React Router Dom
- React Table
- and more third party packages

## Lessons learned

Many things were learned when I worked on the final project of this project, such us:

- Learn to integrate with API
- Creating client-side filters
- Learning the UI Framework, namely Chakra UI
- CRUD process with authentication
- and many more

I'm still learning and trying to keep growing by following technology updates, especially on the frontend.
