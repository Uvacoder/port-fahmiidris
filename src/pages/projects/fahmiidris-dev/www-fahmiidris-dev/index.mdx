This website was established not just as a learning tool, but also as a place for me to write and show off my projects, as well as a repository of my past experiences.

## Short Explanation

This is my personal website, I made this for the purpose of my portfolio. I was also inspired to create a personal blog whose contents tell my thoughts about programming, my life story, and maybe just random stories.

I developed this website using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [MDX v2](https://mdxjs.com).

## Project Goals

Actually I want to create a personal development environment, just like the one in Bandung by [Theodorus Clarence](https://theodorusclarence.com). Starting from starter templates, sort links services, design documentation, etc. I plan to build it all.

## Technology Stack Used

The technology I use is:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [MDX v2](https://mdxjs.com)
- and [More Packages](https://github.com/fahmiidris-labs/fahmiidris.dev/blob/main/package.json)

This personal website will continue to grow! Thank you!
