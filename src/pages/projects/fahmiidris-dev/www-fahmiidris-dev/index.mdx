This website was established not just as a learning tool, but also as a place for me to write and show off my projects, as well as a repository of my past experiences.

## Short explanation

This is my personal website, I made this for the purpose of my portfolio. I was also inspired to create a personal article whose contents tell my thoughts about programming, my life story, and maybe just random stories.

I developed this website using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [MDX v2](https://mdxjs.com).

## Project goals

This website was built not only for portfolios, but as a place for me to learn. I will continue to develop the features on this website from time to time.

Actually I want to create a personal development environment, as made by [Theodorus Clarence](https://theodorusclarence.com). Starting from starter templates, sort links services, design documentation, etc. I plan to build it all.

## Technologies are used

The technology I use is:

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- MDX v2
- and more third party packages

---

This website also has an old version of the UI. Most of the UI, I took references from [Tailwind Labs](https://www.github.com/tailwindlabs) products, such as the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com), [Tailwind UI components](https://tailwindui.com/components), [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com), and others.

## Version v1.0.0

This is version v1.0.0 of my personal website, indeed there are many unfinished features there, at that time I had difficulty completing some features.

You can visit it directly at [https://v1.fahmiidris.dev](https://v1.fahmiidris.dev).

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  {[
    { ...v1Banner, alt: 'Home Page' },
    { ...v1ProjectsPage, alt: 'Projects Page' },
  ].map(({ src, alt, ...image }, index) => (
    <Image.WithCaption key={index} src={src} alt={alt} className="my-0" {...image} />
  ))}
</div>

## Version v0.1.0

This is the initial version of my personal website released. at that time I made it to apply for a job that required having a personal portfolio website.

You can visit it directly at [https://v0.fahmiidris.dev](https://v0.fahmiidris.dev).

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
  {[
    { ...v0Banner, alt: 'Home Page' },
    { ...v0ProjectsPage, alt: 'Projects Page' },
  ].map(({ src, alt, ...image }, index) => (
    <Image.WithCaption key={index} src={src} alt={alt} className="my-0" {...image} />
  ))}
</div>

## Lessons learned

The lessons I've learned while working on this website are mostly React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS fundamentals, then project structures, clean code, and much more.

I'm also getting used to Markdown, especially MDX. Before working on this website I didn't know what Markdown was and what it was created for.

This personal website will continue to grow! Thank you!
