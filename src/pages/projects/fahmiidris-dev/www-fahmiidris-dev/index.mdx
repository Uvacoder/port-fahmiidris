This website was established not just as a learning tool, but also as a place for me to write and show off my projects, as well as a repository of my past experiences.

## Short Explanation

This is my personal website, I made this for the purpose of my portfolio. I was also inspired to create a personal blog whose contents tell my thoughts about programming, my life story, and maybe just random stories.

I developed this website using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), and [MDX v2](https://mdxjs.com).

## Project Goals

Actually I want to create a personal development environment, as made by [Theodorus Clarence](https://theodorusclarence.com). Starting from starter templates, sort links services, design documentation, etc. I plan to build it all.

## Technology Stack Used

The technology I use is:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [MDX v2](https://mdxjs.com)
- and [More Packages](https://github.com/fahmiidris-labs/fahmiidris.dev/blob/main/package.json)

This website also has an old version of the UI. Most of the UI, I took references from [Tailwind Labs](https://www.github.com/tailwindlabs) products, such as the [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com), [Tailwind UI components](https://tailwindui.com/components), [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com), and others.

## Version v1.0.0

This is version v1.0.0 of my personal website, indeed there are many unfinished features there, at that time I had difficulty completing some features.

You can visit it directly at [https://v1.fahmiidris.dev](https://v1.fahmiidris.dev).

<ul className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 sm:grid-cols-3">
  {[
    {
      title: 'Home Page',
      image: { ...v1Banner, alt: 'Home Page' },
    },
    {
      title: 'Experiences Page',
      image: { ...v1ExperiencesPage, alt: 'Experiences Page' },
    },
    {
      title: 'Projects Page',
      image: { ...v1ProjectsPage, alt: 'Projects Page' },
    },
  ].map(({ title, image }, index) => (
    <ImageWithCaption src={image.src} alt={image.alt} {...image} />
  ))}
</ul>

## Version v0.1.0

This is the initial version of my personal website released. at that time I made it to apply for a job that required having a personal portfolio website.

You can visit it directly at [https://v0.fahmiidris.dev](https://v0.fahmiidris.dev).

<ul className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4 sm:grid-cols-3">
  {[
    {
      title: 'Home Page',
      image: { ...v0Banner, alt: 'Home Page' },
    },
    {
      title: 'About Page',
      image: { ...v0AboutPage, alt: 'About Page' },
    },
    {
      title: 'Projects Page',
      image: { ...v0ProjectsPage, alt: 'Projects Page' },
    },
  ].map(({ title, image }, index) => (
    <ImageWithCaption src={image.src} alt={image.alt} {...image} />
  ))}
</ul>
