## My activities during the internship

During my internship, one of them was assigned to add a feature on the eFishery Internal Dashboard and FTS Tools App, the feature is **Expired Ticket** after 30 days. Both of these applications are web based using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).

Besides that, I was also assigned to embed the webview into the mobile application, the task is indeed easy but I have problems when setting up and running the app.
