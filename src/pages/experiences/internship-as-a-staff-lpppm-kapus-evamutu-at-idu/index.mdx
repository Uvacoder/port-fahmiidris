At the beginning of the semester, 11th graders are required to carry out an internship for 3 months as one of the graduation requirements. The place for my internship was determined by the school, and I was placed at the [Indonesian Defense University](https://www.idu.ac.id), to be precise, at the Head of the LPPPM Quality Evaluation Center.
