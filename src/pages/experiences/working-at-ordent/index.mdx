Working as a Frontend Developer at [Ordent](https://www.ordent.co) onsite in Bandung, Indonesia. This is my first work experience (Working onsite in Bandung). I work as a Frontend Developer to contribute to developing the company's client applications.

## My first job

This is my first job as a Frontend Developer, after a long time participating in training and also participating in an internship program, I finally got my first job. I work onsite at a company in Bandung, namely [PT. Orde Digital Intelektual](https://www.ordent.co).

## Fahmi with Ordent part 1

I forget the name of the term, but clearly when I first entered I got a 3 month contract to see my performance during work. During these 3 months, I collaborated with several people on the team, and managed to complete several product modules (although it was a bit difficult).

---

## Fahmi with Ordent part 2

After the 3 month contract period ended, I finally got a contract extension for 1 year. The job desk remains the same, continuing the previous unfinished modules, and I'm happy for this part 2 because in my team there are some people who are already super good skills, so when I'm confused I can ask them.

<Alert message="I can't say what the project is because I'm afraid it's company privacy." />

The technology used is

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- NX for monorepo
- Tailwind CSS
- and more third party packages

## Great new experience

So far, I have learned a lot of new things, both in terms of technical development, meeting clients, and company workflows. Collaborating with the team is also an amazing experience, not only with Senior Frontend Developers, but also with other stack holders.

On my side as a Frontend Developer, I am placed between a **UI/UX Designer** and a **Backend Developer**, honestly this is a new challenge that I have just faced in the real world of work.

### Collaborate with UI/UX Designer

The first part when starting a new module is converting the design to a static web. In this section, I always communicate with the UI/UX Designer to make sure the static web flow is correct or not before starting the integration with the API.

### Collaborate with Backend Developer

After the User Interface has been created, it's time to enter the next stage, namely integration with the API. _Jujurly_, there are a lot of unexpected problems here, but my team and I always try to solve unexpected bugs.

## Something amazing, I guess!

I am motivated by several people in the company, to always keep learning and open up to the public space.

I never thought that the Co-Founder of the company is the Organizer of the Bandung [Google Developer Group](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-bandung) (GDG) Community.

Keep on growing! Thank you!
