## My first job

This is my first job as a Frontend Developer, after a long time participating in training and also participating in an internship program, I finally got my first job. I work onsite at a company in Bandung, namely [PT. Orde Digital Intelektual](https://www.ordent.co).

## Fahmi with Ordent part 1 (3 months contract)

I forget the name of the term, but clearly when I first entered I got a 3 month contract to see my performance during work. During these 3 months, I collaborated with several people on the team, and managed to complete several product modules (although it was a bit difficult).

---

## Fahmi with Ordent part 2 (1 years contract)

After the 3 month contract period ended, I finally got a contract extension for 1 year. The job desk remains the same, continuing the previous unfinished modules, and I'm happy for this part 2 because in my team there are some people who are already super good skills, so when I'm confused I can ask them.

<Alert message="I can't say what the project is because I'm afraid it's company privacy." />

The technology used is

- TypeScript
- Next.js
- NX for monorepo
- and third party packages

Keep on growing! Thank you!
