At the beginning of the semester, 11th graders are required to carry out an internship for 3 months as one of the graduation requirements. The place for my internship was determined by the school, and I was placed at the [Indonesian Defense University](https://www.idu.ac.id), to be precise, at the Head of the LPPPM Quality Evaluation Center.

## Problems

To be honest, all of internship's activities have nothing to do with the programming world, in fact I think it's closer to the work of office staff.

However, the school gave me an assignment to analyze my activities, and look for deficiencies which would later become the material for the title of internship report. Fortunately, at that time there was an activity for students to assess the performance of lecturers, namely the **Lecturer Evaluation by Students** or commonly called **EDOM** (Evaluasi Dosen Oleh Mahasiswa).

I saw a drawback, where at that time the activity was still using **Google Forms**, the results of which later still needed to be processed again so that the collected data could be read easily.

## Solutions

Without thinking, I submitted the title of my internship report, which basically discusses the solution how to make processing super large and complicated respondent data easier by creating a **questionnaire system** using web technology.

<Alert message='The title of my internship report is "Penerapan Sistem Evaluasi Dosen Oleh Mahasiswa (EDOM) Berbasis Web Aplikasi"' />

The technology I used to make it is:

- [Laravel](https://wwww.laravel.com).
- [Vue.js](https://www.vuejs.org).
- [Tailwind CSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com).
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com).

I think, the results from the questionnaire system that I created are sufficient to solve the problems that I have described previously, the results from respondents do not need to be reprocessed because they are directly processed and the report is directly generated by the system.

## Bad news, I lost my source code

I lost the source code on my old laptop (I didn't use GitHub at that time). But, now I'm trying to recreate it as closely as possible. I will try!

Thank you!
