In the last month phase of the [Jabar Coding Camp](https://www.jabarcodingcamp.id) activities, we (participants) participated in internships placed in several JCC partner companies. and I was placed on [eFishery](https://www.efishery.com) to be precise in the Feeder Ops section as a Frontend Developer for 3 months.
