In the last month phase of the [Jabar Coding Camp](https://www.jabarcodingcamp.id) activities, we (participants) participated in internships placed in several JCC partner companies. and I was placed on [eFishery](https://www.efishery.com) to be precise in the Feeder Ops section as a Frontend Developer for 3 months.

There are many new experiences gained during the internship.

- Agile Deployment.
- Development and Deployment Flow.

And many more.

During my internship, one of them was assigned to add a feature on the eFishery Internal Dashboard and FTS Tools App, the feature is **Expired Ticket** after 30 days. Both of these applications are web based using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/).

Besides that, I was also assigned to embed the webview into the mobile application, the task is indeed easy but I have problems when setting up and running the app.
