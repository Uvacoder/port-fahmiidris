import banner from "./images/banner.jpg";

export const meta = {
    title: "Tailwind CSS standard style base",
    description: "The basic style I usually add after preflight in Tailwind CSS.",
    published: 1656090000000,
    image: banner.src,
};

 I separated the base, components, variants and utilities into several files to be imported and put together in a file called `main.css`.
